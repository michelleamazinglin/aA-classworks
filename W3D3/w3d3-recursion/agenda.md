## What Is Recursion?

- A recursive method is a method that calls itself

## What is the point/benefit of making a method recursive?

- Takes a complex problem and breaks it down into simpler sub-problems

- Two things required for a functional recursive solution:
  1. Base case: the smallest sub-problem that we can find an immediate answer to. The case that tells us when to stop running the method.
  2. Inductive/Recursive step: bridges the gap between small problem and smaller sub-problems
